# Data Sets

All of the data collected at NSLS-II is available through the data broker.
The data broker supports rich search queries, and it abstracts away file
formats and file locations so you can focus on the data itself.

That said, there are still times when we have wrangle actual files --- for
example, working with legacy data or data from outside facilities.

This sandbox is running an example data broker, stocked with simulated data
and data from early experiments at NSLS-II. But here we also include some good
old-fashioned data files in various formats.
